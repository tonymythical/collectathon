## Understanding
<<<<<<< HEAD
while loop controls movement and conditions set inside control how the sprite moves, 

While loop controls what happens when the sprite touches the treasure

going up is negative, going down is positive. 

everything seemed logical and understandable, although i may not know exact syntax, i can roughly tell what specific lines aim to accomplish, the logic is similar to that of Java

=======
I found all the functions to be understandable and sensical. I got to understand some familiar functions that got to make the game run and also give me some ideas.

## Planning required changes
Change speed, backdrop color, starting position, game restarts after hitting start, player loops like pacman, make a speed boost function.

Change the speed of the player
Change background color
Change the starting position of the player and dot, making new constexpr for starting X and Y of each 
make it so when the player hits start, the page restarts( the player and treasure are sent back to their initial positions and the score resets to 0)
make it so player loops when going around the screen
give player speed boost when pressing A



## Brainstorming game ideas
1.Let's set an icon/indicator for speed boosts just like for score.
2.Can we perhaps make a ghosting effect upon speed boost activation?
3.Can we add obstacles/boundaries/walls?
4.Can we add a start menu screen?
## Plan for implementing game
1.Set an indicator for speed boost amount.
2.Add a menu separate from game.
3.Added juttering effects for sprite and speed boost.
