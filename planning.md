A place to write your findings and plans

## Understanding
I found all the functions to be understandable and sensical. I got to understand some familiar functions that got to make the game run and also give me some ideas.

## Planning required changes
Change speed, backdrop color, starting position, game restarts after hitting start, player loops like pacman, make a speed boost function.

## Brainstorming game ideas

## Plan for implementing game
